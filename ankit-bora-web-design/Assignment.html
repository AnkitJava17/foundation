        <span style="color: red">One Piece </span>is a Japanese manga series written and
        illustrated by Eiichiro Oda. It has been serialized in Shueisha's shōnen
        manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump since July 1997, with its individual
        chapters compiled into 105 tankōbon volumes as of March 2023. The story
        follows the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy and his crew, the Straw Hat
        Pirates, where he explores the Grand Line in search of the mythical
        treasure known as the "One Piece" in order to become the next King of
        the Pirates. The manga spawned a media franchise, having been adapted
        into a festival film produced by Production I.G, and an anime series
        produced by Toei Animation, which began broadcasting in 1999.
        Additionally, Toei has developed fourteen animated feature films, one
        original video animation, and thirteen television specials. Several
        companies have developed various types of merchandising and media, such
        as a trading card game and numerous video games. The manga series was
        licensed for an English language release in North America and the United
        Kingdom by Viz Media and in Australia by Madman Entertainment. The anime
        series was licensed by 4Kids Entertainment for an English-language
        release in North America in 2004 before the license was dropped and
        subsequently acquired by Funimation in 2007.

        One Piece has received praise for its storytelling, world-building, art,
        characterization, and humor. It has received many awards and is ranked
        by critics, reviewers, and readers as one of the best manga of all time.
        As of August 2022, it had over 516.6 million copies in circulation in 61
        countries and regions worldwide, making it the best-selling manga series
        in history, and the best-selling comic series printed in book volume.
        Several volumes of the manga have broken publishing records, including
        the highest initial print run of any book in Japan. In 2015 and 2022,
        One Piece set the Guinness World Record for "the most copies published
        for the same comic book series by a single author". It was the
        best-selling manga for eleven consecutive years from 2008 to 2018, and
        is the only manga that had an initial print of volumes of above 3
        million continuously for more than 10 years, as well as the only that
        had achieved more than 1 million copies sold in all of its over 100
        published tankōbon volumes. One Piece is the only manga whose volumes
        have ranked first every year in Oricon's weekly comic chart existence
        since 2008. Synopsis Setting See also: List of One Piece characters The
        globe of the One Piece world. The world of One Piece is populated by
        humans and other races, such as dwarves (more akin to faeries), giants,
        merfolk, fish-men, long-limbed tribes, long-necked people known as the
        Snakeneck Tribe, and animal people (known as "Minks"). The world is
        governed by an intercontinental organization known as the World
        Government, consisting of dozens of member states. The central tension
        of the series pits the world government against pirates. The series
        regularly emphasizes moral ambiguity over the label "pirate", which
        includes dastardly villains, but also any individuals that do not submit
        to the world government's authoritarian - and often morally ambiguous -
        rule. The One Piece world also has supernormal characteristics like
        "Devil's Fruits", which are mysterious fruits that grant whoever eats
        them one of three types of transformative powers.

        Examples include a body made of rubber, the ability to transform into
        powerful animals or humanoid-animal hybrid forms, or being able to
        generate, control, or become a certain element. The world itself
        consists of two vast oceans divided by a massive mountain range called
        the Red Line. Within the oceans is a second global phenomenon known as
        the Grand Line, which is a sea that runs perpendicular to the Red Line
        and is bounded by the Calm Belt, strips of calm ocean infested with huge
        ship-eating monsters known as Sea Kings. These geographical barriers
        divide the world into four seas: North Blue, East Blue, West Blue, and
        South Blue. Passage between the four seas, and the Grand Line, is
        therefore difficult. Unique and mystical features enable transport
        between the seas, such as the use of "sea-prism" stone employed by
        government ships to mask their presence as they traverse the Calm Belt,
        or the mystical Reverse Mountain where water from the four seas flows
        uphill before merging into a rapidly flowing and dangerous canal that
        enters the Grand Line. Premise Further information: List of One Piece
        chapters The series focuses on Monkey D. Luffy—a young man made of
        rubber after unintentionally eating a Devil Fruit—who sets off on a
        journey from the East Blue Sea to find the deceased King of the Pirates
        Gol D. Roger's ultimate treasure known as the "One Piece", and takeover
        his prior title. In an effort to organize his own crew, the Straw Hat
        Pirates,[Jp 1] Luffy rescues and befriends a pirate hunter and swordsman
        named Roronoa Zoro, and they head off in search of the titular treasure.
        They are joined in their journey by Nami, a money-obsessed thief and
        navigator; Usopp, a sniper and compulsive liar; and Sanji, an amorous
        but chivalrous cook. They acquire a ship, the Going Merry[Jp 2]—later
        replaced by the Thousand Sunny[Jp 3]—and engage in confrontations with
        notorious pirates of the East Blue. As Luffy and his crew set out on
        their adventures, others join the crew later in the series, including
        Tony Tony Chopper, an anthropomorphized reindeer doctor; Nico Robin, an
        archaeologist and former Baroque Works assassin; Franky, a cyborg
        shipwright; Brook, a skeleton musician and swordsman; and Jimbei, a
        whale shark-type fish-man and former member of the Seven Warlords of the
        Sea who becomes their helmsman. Together, they encounter other pirates,
        bounty hunters, criminal organizations, revolutionaries, secret agents,
        different types of scientists, soldiers of the morally-ambiguous World
        Government, and various other friends and foes, as they sail the seas in
        pursuit of their dreams. Production Concept and creation Eiichiro Oda's
        interest in pirates began in his childhood, watching the animated series
        Vicky the Viking, which inspired him to want to draw a manga series
        about pirates.[2] The reading of pirate biographies influenced Oda to
        incorporate the characteristics of real-life pirates into many of the
        characters in One Piece; for example, the character Marshall D. Teach is
        based on and named after the historical pirate Edward "Blackbeard"
        Teach.[3] Apart from the history of piracy, Oda's biggest influence is
        Akira Toriyama and his series Dragon Ball, which is one of his favorite
        manga.[4] He was also inspired by The Wizard of Oz, claiming not to
        endure stories where the reward of adventure is the adventure itself,
        opting for a story where travel is important, but even more important is
        the goal.[5] While working as an assistant to Nobuhiro Watsuki, Oda
        began writing One Piece in 1996.[6] It started as two one-shot stories
        entitled Romance Dawn[6]—which would later be used as the title for One
        Piece's first chapter and volume. They both featured the character of
        Luffy, and included elements that would appear later in the main series.
        The first of these short stories was published in August 1996 in Akamaru
        Jump and later in One Piece Red. The second was published in the 41st
        issue of Weekly Shōnen Jump in 1996, and reprinted in 1998 in Oda's
        short story collection, Wanted!.[7]
